ルインフォートレス外郭で秘密裏に建造中だった巨大艦船、アークシップに逃走したアベルとシオンを追撃する作戦が展開される。

エドガーが撒いた狂気の戦雲は未だにロコタウンの上空を覆っていた。
エドガーの人形軍団の総攻撃からRスクエアを死守せよ！

ロコタウン襲撃のフィナーレを飾る最後のパレードを準備するエドガー。しかし、エドガーの残酷な祭りもここで幕を閉じるだろう。

自爆装置のボタンを押した瞬間、N-102最後の脱出路が開いた。目の前に立ちはだかる強大な敵「ビホールダー」を倒して生きて脱出せよ。

ネッドカンパニーの野望は生きている人を使った禁断の実験だった。
ソウルワーカー量産計画を阻止し、犠牲者に安息を与えよう。

最強の無人ロボットが完成を待ち、眠っていたアケロンの別の侵入路。長い眠りから目覚めた無人ロボットを突破し、作戦を成功させなければならない。

スタリーフォレスト連合の隊員が戦闘能力を試す場所。
試験用に改造されたロボットがスタリーフォレスト連合の隊員を待ち構える。

一人の子どもを助けるため、工事が中断されたボーリング現場に駆けつけるミリアム。だが、突如現れたソウルジャンクの襲撃で孤立してしまい…。

ボーリング現場で動き回るソウルジャンク「ドレッド」。
ウォーレンの病院を破壊し、ロコタウンを伝染病の恐怖に
突き落とした元凶。伝染病が流行る前に始末しよう。

ミリアムの頼みで来たボーリング現場。
ソウルジャンクによって孤立した生存者を探し出し、
救出しなければならない。

覚醒体が現れたという情報の真偽を確かめようと、
リューが一人現場へ向かった。何が起こるかわからない。
急いで彼と合流しよう。

道化師の招待状が指す場所は捨てられた広場通り。
そこにはどんなプレゼントが待っているのだろうか?

広場の通りを埋め尽くすほどの人形。
一時は人々の活気溢れる町だったが、
今は感情のない人形が支配する町と化してしまった。

ビッグパペットの進撃を止めるためには、ネッドカンパニーが支援するヘリが必要。人形がヘリを破壊する前に奴らを止めなければならない。

オペレーション[ザ・シールド]。ビッグパペットを直接おびき寄せ、防護壁内で自爆させるという危険な作戦。この作戦だけは必ず成功させなければならない。

新たに現れた人形たち。
それらを調査しに行った捜索隊が戻ってこない。
嫌な予感がする…。

人形になってしまった人々、
そして不気味な塔とせわしなく動く人形…。
人形は、一体何のために塔を建てているのだろうか?

人間を人形へと変化させるのは、他ならぬあの塔だった。
ベンジャミンは被害の拡大を防ぐために塔の破壊を指示する。

喋る人形、コードネーム[ジャック・ザ・キング]。
今この状況を打開する唯一の方法は、ジャック・ザ・キングを倒すことだけだ。

とうとう[青炎の道化師]の尻尾を掴んだ。
彼が陣取った場所はロコタウンに近い、廃墟の病院だった。先発隊を探し、青炎の道化師を追跡しよう。

青炎の道化師に辿り着くには特殊なバッジがなければ
ならないという情報を入手した。
バッジは病院内の人形が持っている。

青炎の道化師がいる病棟に到着した。バッジにより磁気フィールドを中和させ、ようやく進めるようになった。

逃げた青炎の道化師「エドガー」は、最後の決戦の場所として病院の屋上にあるサーカステントを指定した。
なんとしても奴を倒さなければ。

新しい都市に着くや否や息つく間もなく始まった作戦。カンダスシティの補給路を確保するため、海岸道路のソウルジャンクを始末しよう。

ネッドカンパニーの傭兵の情報によって、まだ海岸道路に強力なソウルジャンクがいることが確認された。
いつも怒っているらしいが…。

最近、海岸道路に不可解な地震が増えている。高架道路や建物が崩壊する危険があるので、原因を突き止めなければならない。

再び現れたソウルジャンクの群れ。アーロン中佐はカンダスシティ防衛のためにソウルジャンクの始末と、唯一の補給路である海岸トンネルの破壊を指示する。

ネッドカンパニーの許可をもらい入った地下水路。
激しい悪臭により呼吸するのも辛い。
確かにここには何かが存在するような感じがする…。

都市の各所に、地下水路から出た悪臭が立ち込み始めた。
悪臭の原因が地下水路にあることだけは明らかだが…。

ネッドカンパニーから大勢の傭兵と研究員が地下水路に派遣された。不審に思ったブロックは彼らの監視を指示する。

ジャンクナイトの出現はスタリーフォレスト連合全体に衝撃を与えた。ブロックは、ネッドカンパニーに責任を問うためにジャンクナイトのサンプル確保を指示した。

ネッドカンパニーが何かを運ぼうとした輸送船が、近くの屋敷に墜落したらしい。
何を輸送しようとしていたのかを調査する必要がある。

屋敷全体がソウルジャンクの巣窟になってしまった。
強力な感染力を持つソウルジャンクがいるため、外に出る前に始末せねばならない。

ラルフの話から考えると、キャサリンは屋敷内部にいる可能性が高い。キャサリンを探しに屋敷の奥へ進んでみよう。

キャサリンをさらったアラクニスというソウルジャンクが、
屋敷の地下の奥に隠れているという。
急いでキャサリンを探しだそう。

バキュームベインに感染したキャサリンを救うことができる唯一の解毒剤が、ネッドカンパニーの研究所内にある。
しかし、研究所は既にソウルジャンクの巣窟となり…。

第二研究所内部もやはりソウルジャンクの巣窟に…。一体何がこの場所であったのかはわからないが、今はキャサリンの解毒剤を確保することが優先だ。

ビクターはキャサリンのことへの罪悪感から解毒剤を探しに一人で研究所へと入っていった。
彼がソウルジャンクに襲われる前に見つけ出そう。

ヘンリーは解毒剤を使用するためにはビホールダーの粘液が必要だと言い、さらに研究所の爆破も指示する。

ロコタウンから戻ると、カンダスシティはすさまじい数のソウルジャンクに襲撃されていた。人々を退避させるために防空壕の開閉装置を作動させなければならない。

防空壕内部、輸送船に向かう道で多数のソウルジャンクが発見された。人々が攻撃されないよう先に処理しよう。

住民の大部分を避難させ、残りはキャサリンと自分たちだけだった。しかしその時、乗る予定の輸送船に多くのソウルジャンクが向かうのを目撃した。

カンダスシティからの脱出を開始した。
しかし、ソウルジャンクの襲撃はしつこく、皆の不安は募るばかりだった。

ヘンリー追跡を優先したいところだが、ヴェシとの戦闘経験を積むための命令が下った。今は黙って動くしかない。

力のデザイアを崇拝するヴェシ「ラピッドフレイム」。その突撃部隊が高速道路からグレイスシティへ侵攻する隙を虎視眈々と狙っている。

ヘンリーが乗っていたと思われる車輌が発見された。不明な点が山ほどあるが、今は彼の身柄を確保しなければならない。ヴェシにやられる前に…。

捜していたヘンリーは見当たらず、ラピッドフレイム勢力の幹部「スカー」が高速道路に姿を現した。 ヘンリーの行方を知るためには、スカーから討伐しなければならない。

ヘンリーがネッドカンパニーの本社に侵入後、
ラピッドフレイムの奇襲部隊が建物を占領した。
気は進まないが、彼を救出しなければ…。

ネッドカンパニー内はラピッドフレイムの占拠によって
電力供給が行き届いていない状況だ。 

ネッドカンパニーの電力を復旧させるには、
建物内の電力を手動で作動させなければならない。
ラピッドフレイムがその「カギ」を持っているらしい。

カンダスシティの事件の証拠を入手するためには、
ネッドカンパニー内部にあるセキュリティボックスの
全データをコピーしなければならない。

第2高速道路を侵攻するラピッドフレイムの強襲部隊を討伐するための作戦「ウルフクライ」が発動されたら、ヒルブレイカーの射撃場所を確保しなければならない。

作戦名「ウルフクライ」は、高周波を発生させるミサイル「ファイナルアリア」を上空に打ち上げ、強襲部隊の主力であるクイーンカルラを殲滅するという作戦だ。

アリアミサイル発射ポイントまでヒルブレイカーが移動できない。スタリーフォレスト連合のソウルワーカー「ケインバレル」とラピッドフレイムの強襲部隊討伐に向かう。

愛鳥のクイーンカルラに傷を負わせたので、ラピッドフレイムの強襲部隊長ファルコンが姿を現した。ついに出てきた相手に、感謝の気持ちすら湧き上がる。

人はおらず静寂だけが町を覆う中、デーブタウンに降る冷たい雨が嫌な予感を感じさせていた。

グレイスシティ付近の小さな町「デーブタウン」は、戦場から離れていて自給自足できるという理由で、多くの市民が居住していた。

嫌な予感が当たらないように願う状況。デーブタウン内部でソウル経路を確認するため、「スピリットパスファインダー」の設置を急がなければならない。

嫌な予感は現実のものとなってしまった。これほどのことをしてまで彼らが求める物はなんなのだろうか?しかし、今は生存者を探すのが優先だ。

ヘンリーとラピッドフレイム勢力との同盟が現実となった。非道の限りを尽くすヘンリーを捕まえ罪を償わせないといけない。

ラピッドフレイム勢力の本拠地だと思われていた場所は、ネッドカンパニーとラピッドフレイムがでっちあげた罠だった。

ネッドカンパニーの罠によって、グレイスシティの多くの戦力が失われ、存立を脅かすほどの危機が訪れた。このままみんなを死なせるわけにはいかない。

ラピッドフレイム勢力の暗殺部隊が支援部隊救出を妨害している。一人でも多く救出するためにも妨害する敵を倒す必要がある。

ネッドカンパニーが軍事衛星インドラをハッキングした痕跡が見つかった。ハッキングの痕跡を辿って彼らの本当の本拠地を突き止めなければならない。

グレイスシティ外郭山脈付近にネッドカンパニーの痕跡が残っていた。彼らに審判を下す時がきた。

ヘンリーとラウファーの行方を捜すためには軍事衛星インドラを妨害する電波を除去しなければならない。

インドラの施設内部をスキャンした結果、ヘンリーとラウファーと推定される生命反応を感知した。今こそ理想的な復讐をする時だ。

ソウルワーカーのために開発された仮想訓練装置。データベースに登録された敵を具現化し、実践同様の戦闘が可能。しかし、エナジー消費が激しいため頻繁には利用できない。

空白によって完全に廃墟と化した地域。持続的にソウルジャンクが発生しており、スタリーフォレスト連合は立入禁止区域に指定。民間人の立ち入りを禁止している。

突如発生した謎の歪みは、多くの人形をこの世へと解き放った。彼らが現れた理由を知る者は誰もいない。ただ、人形が持つ力と強烈なまでの敵意だけは明らかだった。

LION GAMES PRESENT

見覚えのない場所。
見知らぬ人々。
聞きなれない会話。
私の知っている世界はなくなっていた…。
これからどうなっちゃうんだろう……?

目覚めたら、世界は一変していた。
怪物が徘徊し、人々が超能力を使う世界。
俺が創ろうとしていた世界が…目の前に広がっていた。
これは…興奮するなっていう方がムリな話だよな。

今までの常識が通用しない世界…。
でも…。
わたくしは今まで、望むものは全て手に入れてきた。
この世界でも…今まで通りにするだけ。

15年も眠っていた間に、世界は随分と変わってしまったようだ。
生き残ることが優先される世界…。
だが…オレは今までだって必死だった。
人間らしく…情熱をもって生き続けることに…。

いつの間にか15年経ってたみたい。
冬眠したクマって、こんな感じなのかな…?
みんな難しい話ばっかり…お腹ペコペコなのに…。
…でも、みんながいるから寂しくない。

もう、私が知ってる世界はない。
全てが不慣れで窮屈で、一分一秒もここにいたくない。
けど、我慢するしかない。
もう、ここが私の世界であり…私が生きていくべき世界だから。
我慢して我慢して、耐えるしか…。

こんにちは。
私、この入り混じりし世にて至極のショーを求め彷徨う「道化師エドガー」と申します。
突然のお手紙に、さぞ驚かれたことでしょう。
ですが、あなたの力に感嘆を禁じえなかったこの思いをお伝えしたかったのです。
あなたのその力は、短い我が人生の中でもっとも美しく印象的でした。
華やかでありながら地味で、美しくも汚らわしい、
そして…平穏でありながら破壊的な…。
この破裂しそうな私の気持ちをどう表現すべきか、悩んだ末に結論を出しました。
あなたに…ささやかなプレゼントを贈ります。
その力に対し敬意を表するという意味ゆえ、どうか拒否されませんよう。
プレゼントは、あなた方が「ショッピングストリート」と呼ぶ場所で確認できます。
願わくば…気に入ってくださらんことを祈りつつ。
-道化師エドガーより-

少しずつ、あなたとの距離が縮まるのを感じます。
遅かれ早かれ出会うことになりますが、
待つ時間が長いほど、出会いの瞬間というのはすばらしく輝くものです。
ドラマチックな状況を演出するために、ちょっとしたゲームを準備いたしました。
私がいる部屋の前へは、今のあなたの力では辿り着くことはできません。
しかし、私の部下が持っているバッジを身につけたなら、 
明け方の森の中を歩くかのごとく通過できるよう演出しました。
お急ぎください。
あなたを待ち焦がれるこの気持ちが、憎悪に変わるその前に…。
-道化師エドガーより-

-レポート：アマリリス-

1．SJ-DS-01にソウルエナジー耐性機能を追加。状態はとても不安定。

2．SJ-DS-01は、ソウルエナジーの宿主である人間に寄生できることが判明。
寄生対象となった人間は、ソウルエナジーを持続的に奪われ、皮膚が石膏のように固まってSJ-DS-01の食料となる。

3．SJ-DS-01をディグニティースナッチャーと名付ける。ディグニティースナッチャーの内部に蓄えられているソウルエナジーの総量が存在することが明らかになる。しかし、平凡な人間は該当総量を全て満たす程のソウルエナジーを持ち合わせていない。現在の総量は測定不可。

-レポート：テンペスト-
1. 精密な機械で構成されている。ラピッドフレイムの技術レベルを根拠に検討した結果、ラピッドフレイム自体では製作不可能であるという結論。外部の支援があったと判断。

2. 武装は、高密度のデザイアエナジーを発射する主砲。

3. 特殊ワイヤーと握力700kgの爪が特殊武装として装着。
しかし、武装としての性能は期待できない水準。

4. 特殊ワイヤーは、ソウルエナジーの保管及び移動を可能にした特殊材料で構成。

-ある雲った日。
あの子の暴走は予想していた。むしろ、それを「災い」呼ぶ者たちを理解できなかった。我々は罪を犯し、それを償う時がやって来た…ただそれだけだ。他の子らの代わりに、裁きを下しに来たのだ。それがもし復讐という名を持っていたとしても、私は甘んじて受け入れる。

-ある雪の日。
あの子は愚かな人間たちによって再び眠りについた。彼らは、あの子が眠れば全て終わるという甘い考えに染まっていた。ネッドカンパニーが我々を助けてくれるなどという愚かな考えに腹が立った。彼らはきっと、真実を知る者全てを葬り去るだろう。何事もなかったかのように。

-ある晴れた日。
この施設の閉鎖が決まり、首脳部を除く全ての人間はこの地獄へ取り残されることになった。おそらく、そう長くは保たないだろう。罪深き我々の最後にはお似合いだ。…不思議な気分だ。あれほど怖がっていた死が、今はまったく怖くない。

Model Name：NS_EX_008
Name：Cleany

1. その名の通り掃除専用ロボット。私物に込められたソウルエナジーを判別し、分別収集及び紛失物捜索に適する。

2. 現在は動力喪失状態のため、強制スリープモードに入っている。エナジーを3回に分けて順番に注入すれば、自らスリープモードを解除し動き出す。
(動作までに約24時間所要)

3. コアが破壊されたり消失した場合、コアを取り換えた後に使用可能な増幅装置をコアのあった位置へ設置すると、コアが復活する。
(注意：動力源が1%でも残っている必要あり)

数少ないヒントでここまで至った方に、まずは感謝の意を表します。
このルインフォートレスで「人間」以外の者に罪はありません。
このロボットもまた何の罪もない存在です。
「HELP ME」という文字に反応し、ここまで来たあなたなら、きっとこの子を受け入れてくれるはずです。よろしくお願いします。 
そして、クリーニー。どうか、幸せに…。
